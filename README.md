# Demo Django Project

This is simple CRUD application that uses the Django framework. This project is based on the Django Workshop. To see full project that was the basis of the workshop, here is the [link](https://github.com/cr8ivecodesmith/djnotes2
)

## Requirements 
- Django. Recommended version used is provided in **requirements.txt** in case problems occur
- Virtualenv. It strongly recommended to always run in a sandboxed environment especially when working on mulitple projects. For more information please check out the [official documentation](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). 
    - Alternatively you can also use [conda environments](https://conda.io/)




## How to run : 

When the requirements have been installed first run the migration tool to initialize the database.

`python manage.py migrate`

 This uses SQLite for portability. 

Then : 

`python manage.py runserver`
